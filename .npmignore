# playwright-mapper

Run only the Playwright tests that matter based on changed files.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D playwright-mapper
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize config files
npx playwright-mapper init

# Run tests based on changed files
npx playwright-mapper
```

## How it works

1. Detects changed files in your branch
2. Maps them to test tags via `test-mappings.js`
3. Runs only relevant Playwright tests

See the [full documentation](README.md) for details.
